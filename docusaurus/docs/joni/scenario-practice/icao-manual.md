## 3.10 Common Mistakes and LLM Error Classification

These are typical deviations from ICAO standards, useful for LLM response feedback:

| Error Type | Label | Description |
|------------|-------|-------------|
| Incorrect Phraseology | PHRASE | Use of informal or unapproved wording |
| Pronunciation Errors | NUM, ALPHA | Non-standard pronunciation of numbers or letters |
| Sequence Violation | SEQ | Incorrect or reversed call structure |
| Readback Missing | READ | No readback for required clearance |
| Incorrect Heading Form | DIR_FORMAT | Heading missing "HEADING" or incorrect digits |
| Altitude Reporting | ALT_FORMAT | Incorrect FL format or wrong unit used |
| Emergency Phrase Error | EMERG | Omission or misuse of MAYDAY/PAN PAN |
| Call Sign Error | CALLSIGN | Omitted, shortened, or incorrect call sign |

### Example Evaluation (Incorrect User Response)

**User**: "Okay, going down to twenty thousand."

**LLM Feedback Tags**: PHRASE, ALT_FORMAT, READ

**Suggested Correction**: "DESCENDING TO FLIGHT LEVEL TWO ZERO ZERO, SPEEDBIRD ONE TWO THREE."
