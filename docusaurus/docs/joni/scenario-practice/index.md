# Scenario Practice

## Overview

Scenario Practice is an interactive training feature that allows pilots to practice their communication and decision-making skills through realistic flight scenarios. Each practice session presents dynamic situations that pilots may encounter during any phase of flight, from routine operations to unexpected emergencies.

## How It Works

### 1. Scenario Structure
Each scenario consists of:
- **Flight Information**: Aircraft type, callsign, ATIS information, current position/phase, and relevant conditions
- **Dynamic Script**: A flexible sequence of events that can include routine operations or unexpected situations
- **Expected Response Components**: The key elements that must be included in each pilot response
- **Example Answers**: Correct phraseology examples for various situations

### 2. Practice Flow
1. The system presents a scenario with initial context
2. An event occurs - this could be:
   - ATC communication
   - Emergency situation
   - Crew interaction (flight attendant reporting an issue)
   - Technical malfunction
   - Weather-related challenge
   - Passenger-related incident
3. The pilot provides their response
4. The system validates if the response contains the required components
5. If correct, the scenario advances to the next event
6. If incorrect, the pilot must try again before progressing

### 3. Types of Scenarios
Scenarios can include various situations beyond standard flight operations:

#### Standard Operations
- **Routine Communications**: Clearance, taxi, takeoff, cruise, approach, landing
- **Frequency Changes**: Handoffs between controllers
- **Route Modifications**: Weather deviations, shortcuts, holding patterns

#### Non-Routine Events
- **Medical Emergencies**: Passenger or crew medical issues requiring diversion
- **Technical Issues**: System failures, engine problems, pressurization issues
- **Security Situations**: Unruly passengers, security threats
- **Weather Challenges**: Turbulence reports, windshear warnings, icing conditions
- **Operational Issues**: Ground stops, runway changes, gate unavailability

#### Crew Resource Management
- **Flight Attendant Reports**: Passenger issues, cabin problems
- **Cockpit Coordination**: Co-pilot interactions, checklist responses
- **Company Communications**: Dispatch messages, maintenance requests

## Key Features

### Progressive Learning
- Pilots must correctly complete each step before advancing
- Ensures proper understanding of each communication phase
- Builds confidence through repetition and practice

### Realistic Scenarios
- Based on real-world aviation situations
- Includes proper ICAO phraseology for all communications
- Features various aircraft types (Boeing 787, Airbus A330, etc.)
- Covers diverse situations from routine to emergency
- Incorporates crew resource management scenarios

### Validation System
- Checks for required components in pilot responses
- Ensures proper callsign usage (including "Heavy" designation)
- Validates acknowledgment of instructions
- Confirms correct readback of critical information

## Benefits

1. **Safe Learning Environment**: Practice handling complex situations without real-world consequences
2. **Standardized Communication**: Master proper ICAO phraseology and professional communication
3. **Decision-Making Skills**: Develop quick thinking and appropriate responses to unexpected events
4. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Experience diverse scenarios from routine to emergency situations
5. **Self-Paced Learning**: Practice at your own speed and comfort level
6. **Crew Resource Management**: Learn effective communication with cabin crew and other personnel

## Example Scenario Components

### Example 1: Standard Operation
**Flight Information**:
```
Aircraft: Boeing 787-9
Callsign: EL AL 321 Heavy
Phase: Pre-departure
Location: Stand B4
```

**Event**: ATC clearance delivery
**ATC**: "EL AL 321 Heavy, cleared to London Heathrow via PURLA 1A departure, climb 6000 feet, squawk 7312."

**Expected Response Components**: Destination, departure, altitude, squawk, callsign
**Correct Response**: "Cleared to London Heathrow via PURLA 1A, climb 6000 feet, squawk 7312, EL AL 321 Heavy."

### Example 2: Non-Routine Event
**Flight Information**:
```
Aircraft: Boeing 777-200
Callsign: EL AL 007 Heavy
Phase: Cruise
Position: FL350, 120nm west of Shannon
```

**Event**: Flight attendant reports medical emergency
**Flight Attendant**: "Captain, we have a passenger experiencing severe chest pains in row 32. A doctor on board is attending but recommends immediate landing."

**Expected Response Components**: Acknowledge situation, state intentions, prepare for coordination
**Correct Response**: "Understood, passenger with chest pains, doctor recommending diversion. Prepare cabin for possible descent, I'll coordinate with ATC for nearest suitable airport."

**Follow-up Event**: Contact ATC
**Expected Components**: Emergency declaration, nature, souls on board, fuel, intentions
**Correct Response**: "London Control, EL AL 007 Heavy, PAN PAN PAN, medical emergency on board, request immediate vectors to nearest suitable airport, 285 souls on board, 4 hours fuel remaining."

## Getting Started

To begin practicing, select a scenario from the available options. Each scenario is designed to challenge your communication skills and decision-making abilities through realistic situations you may encounter as a pilot. Scenarios range from routine operations to complex emergency situations, helping you build confidence and proficiency in all aspects of aviation communication.
