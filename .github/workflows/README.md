# GitHub Actions Workflows

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and dependency monitoring.

## Workflows

### 1. CI (`ci.yml`)
**Triggers:** Push to main/develop, Pull Requests, Manual dispatch

**What it does:**
- âœ… Installs dependencies for the monorepo
- âœ… Runs TypeScript type checking for both server and webapp
- âœ… Runs ESLint for code quality
- âœ… Sets up PostgreSQL database for tests
- âœ… Runs all tests with coverage reporting
- âœ… Builds the webapp to ensure it compiles

**When to use:** This runs automatically on every push and PR. It ensures code quality and that all tests pass.

### 2. Dependency Check (`dependency-check.yml`)
**Triggers:** Weekly (Mondays 9 AM UTC), Manual dispatch

**What it does:**
- ðŸ“¦ Checks for outdated npm packages
- ðŸ”’ Runs security audit on dependencies
- ðŸ“‹ Creates GitHub issues if vulnerabilities are found

**When to use:** This helps maintain security by monitoring dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
